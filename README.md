# Wynergy Sovereign Trust Platform (WSTP)

A next-generation, sovereign-grade digital trust infrastructure designed for global licensing, identity, compliance, and distributed verification systems.

WSTP is built on a multi-layered trust kernel that exceeds the capabilities of traditional PKI, blockchain licensing, or commercial IAM platforms. It delivers cryptographic assurance, federated authority, offline validation, activation workflows, and post-quantum readiness.

This platform underpins the emerging Wynergy ecosystem, WFSL operations, SAS-CIC compliance tooling, and cross-sector enterprise solutions.

## 1. Architecture Overview

WSTP consists of six sovereign-grade subsystems:

1. **Trust Core**  
   Identity, lineage, policy, PQ flags, and trust metadata.

2. **Cryptographic Runtime**  
   SHA-512 hashing, Merkle anchoring, hybrid PQ-seal scaffolding.

3. **Trust Validator**  
   Seal verification, lineage validation, policy enforcement, AI metric integration.

4. **Trust Graph Engine**  
   Distributed trust propagation, anomaly detection, cross-domain trust weighting.

5. **Trust State Machine**  
   Autonomous trust evolution, authority overrides, decay and reinforcement logic.

6. **Federated Authority Engine**  
   Cross-realm authority merging, PQ-ready federation seals, lineage consolidation.

On top of this kernel, WSTP provides:

• Sovereign Licence Authority  
• Licence Registry  
• Activation Engine  
• Offline Validation Engine  
• Cloud API Integration (Workers, KV, D1-ready)

## 2. Why Sovereign Trust?

Traditional PKI and blockchain licensing cannot meet modern requirements:

- They lack autonomous trust evolution  
- They cannot operate offline convincingly  
- They cannot federate multiple authorities dynamically  
- They do not support AI risk signals  
- They have no trust graph intelligence  
- They do not provide multi-domain lineage  
- They do not offer PQ-ready trust envelopes  

WSTP solves all of these with a unified cryptographic trust kernel.

## 3. Core Subsystems

### 3.1 Trust Core
Defines the fundamental trust object, including identity, lineage, policy rules, and PQ capabilities.

### 3.2 Cryptographic Runtime
Uses deterministic SHA-512, Merkle chains, hybrid PQ scaffolding, and sealed trust envelopes.

### 3.3 Trust Validator
Validates seals, lineage, trust policies, and AI metrics. Produces full attestation objects.

### 3.4 Trust Graph Engine
Models trust relationships across nodes and authorities. Detects anomalies. Supports federated scoring.

### 3.5 Trust State Machine
Controls how trust changes over time. Enforces authority overrides, trust decay, reinforcement, and risk thresholds.

### 3.6 Federated Authority Engine
Combines multiple authorities into a unified lineage. Enables sovereign interoperability and distributed governance.

## 4. Licence Layer

### Licence Authority
Issues PQ-sealed licences backed by lineage, trust state, federated authority weighting, and activation policies.

### Licence Registry
Local and distributed (KV-ready) registry with PQ-ready integrity hashing and revocation support.

---

## 5. Activation Layer

### Activation Engine
Device-based activation with PQ-sealed activation keys and offline compatibility.

### Offline Validator
A fully air-gapped validator capable of:

- licence validation  
- activation verification  
- audit packet integrity checks  
- trust-state reconstruction  
- federated lineage alignment  

No internet required.
